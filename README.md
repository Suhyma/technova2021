Plant Buddy is a Google Chrome extension that allows the user to set goals for themselves for things like how many cups of water to drink in a day or taking a certain number of breaks while working. Throughout the day, the user can log the progress for each of these goals. Depending on how well the goals are being met, our Plant Buddy, Leafy, will be at different growth stages. For example, at the start of the day with no progress on the goals, Leafy will be in a bud state - with lots of room to grow! As the user makes a bit more progress during the day, Leafy will grow a bit taller. Finally, once the goals are all met, Leafy is in full, beautiful bloom (just like you!).
